## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, zenquotes API, unsplash API

I led another developer in the creation of this app using a kanban board from Asana. I was tasked with the creation of the pomodoro timer, the embedding of the spoify player, and overall creation of the front end of the app. I assigned the other collaborator to implement changes to the APIs. The app uses OOP with a pomodoro class in order to handle all timer functionality. It is a basic pomodoro timer with 4 intervals of 25 minutes of work with 3 breaks of 5 minutes and 1 break of 15 minutes. Image changes are used via calls to the Unsplash API. Quote changes are handled via calls to zenquotes.io.

## Optimizations
I would love to expand on this app in the future to feature login capabilities and work time tracking, as well as analytics to cover intervals between start and stop of breaks and work to show how much in between time the user is experiencing. I know I might take a bit longer of a work period, or break period and don't actually press the start button of the next phase for a bit. That makes me curious how much time I actually spend in between phases.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first time leading another developer in creation of an app. It was important to have meetings to discuss both of our roles and expecations. Having structure in the app itself to which the other developer could contribute towards was also something I learned was essential for good workflow. I really liked the use of a kanban board, and it was both of our first times implementing agile methodologies for our workflow and during meetings.
